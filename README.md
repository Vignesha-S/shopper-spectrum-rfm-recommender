# 🛒 Shopper Spectrum: Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendations in E-Commerce

This end-to-end machine learning project segments customers based on purchasing behavior and recommends similar products using collaborative filtering. Built using Python, the solution combines data preprocessing, clustering (KMeans), cosine similarity, and a clean interactive Streamlit interface for business-ready insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In the competitive e-commerce space, understanding customer behavior is crucial. This project explores a real-world e-commerce dataset to uncover customer patterns and make actionable insights available through:

- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- 📊 **RFM-Based Customer Segmentation**
- 🔁 **Collaborative Filtering for Product Recommendation**
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App for Deployment**

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🎯 Customer Segmentation (RFM + Clustering)

* RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores calculated for each customer.
* Standardized and clustered using KMeans.
* Cluster segments: **High-Value**, **Regular**, **Occasional**, and **At-Risk**.

### 🛍 Product Recommendation (Collaborative Filtering)

* Cosine similarity computed between products using a Customer-Product matrix.
* Recommends top 5 similar items based on product selection.

### 🌐 Interactive Streamlit Web App

* Three navigable pages: **Home**, **Customer Segmentation**, **Product Recommendation**
* Built for business users to explore customer clusters and get recommendations.

## 📌 Problem Statement

How can we understand customer behavior, segment customers meaningfully, and recommend relevant products in an e-commerce business using past transactional data?

---

## 📒 RFM Full Form

* **Recency**: Days since the customer’s last purchase
* **Frequency**: Total number of transactions
* **Monetary**: Total amount spent
